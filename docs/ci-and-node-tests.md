# CI and Node Test Contract

This project runs unit tests directly with Node. Astro/Vite supplies TypeScript, aliases, and extension resolution during development, but `node --test` does not; code loaded by tests must work in both environments.

## What CI actually runs

`.github/workflows/ci.yml` has four jobs:

| Job | Contents |
| --- | --- |
| `quality` | `biome ci ./src` — **blocking** (a failure fails the run) |
| `checks` | `astro check`, `pnpm check:manifest`, `pnpm type-check`, `node --test "tests/**/*.test.mjs"` (Node 22) |
| `build` | `pnpm build` on Node 22 and 24 |
| `e2e` | `pnpm test:ci` (Playwright, Node 22) |

Two things are easy to get wrong here:

- **`pnpm type-check` covers `src/` *and* `tests/`** via `tsconfig.check.json`; the root `tsconfig.json` stays `src`-only for the editor and `astro check`. Tests were outside the type system for a long time, which let assertions reference non-existent `I18nKey` members and silently pass. If you add a test path that TypeScript cannot resolve, this is the step that fails.
- **`e2e` runs `pnpm test:ci`, not `pnpm test`.** That is `playwright test --grep-invert @visual`: pixel baselines only hold for the platform that generated them, so the `@visual` group is a **local, pre-release** gate. Run full `pnpm test` on the machine that owns the baselines before releasing — see `rules/visual-regression.md` §8.

## Runtime boundaries

- Do not make a pure Node test path import a TypeScript module containing a runtime `enum`. Node's strip-only TypeScript loader does not support `enum`.
- When a Node test needs enum-shaped keys, expose string keys through an `.mjs` runtime bridge and keep the TypeScript declaration in a matching `.d.mts` file.
- TypeScript files loaded directly by Node must use explicit `.ts` extensions for relative imports. Do not rely on Vite aliases such as `@/`.
- User-facing copy must still go through `i18n()` and the `I18nKey` registry. A runtime bridge changes loading only; it must not duplicate translations or bypass the ten locale modules.

## Local validation order

After changing Markdown processing, i18n modules, or test loading paths, run:

```powershell
pnpm.cmd exec biome ci ./src
npx.cmd astro check
pnpm.cmd check:manifest
pnpm.cmd type-check
node --test "tests/**/*.test.mjs"
git diff --check
```

Node's strip-only loader accepts `.ts` imports (the locale modules rely on this), but the same rule as above applies: no runtime `enum`, and relative imports need explicit extensions.

Do not run `astro check` in parallel with content-sync tests. Astro check triggers content synchronization, while `tests/content/*` uses temporary repository fixtures; concurrent runs can cause false failures such as empty stderr. Run the complete unit suite separately.

## GitHub Actions diagnosis

Inspect the run summary first, then the failed job logs:

```powershell
gh run view <run-id> --json status,conclusion,headSha,jobs,url
gh run view <run-id> --job <job-id> --log-failed
```

Reproduce the failed step locally with the same Node major version and command. Keep build, diagnostics, and unit-test failures separate; change implementation only when the failure reproduces in an isolated run.

## Before committing

- Review `git diff` and confirm locale files contain only required import or formatting changes.
- Stage paths explicitly. Never use `git add -A`, which can include `Shirone-Content/`, temporary fixtures, or build output.
- Use a conventional commit such as `fix(markdown): support direct Node markdown tests`.
